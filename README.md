## About me
A backend Scala developer at Wix.com, working on tooling around our data streaming infrastructure based on Kafka.\
Checkout our opensource Kafka library [Greyhound](https://github.com/wix/greyhound).\
Love FP, recently have been very impressed with [ZIO](https://zio.dev) and its emerging echo-system. Enjoyed attending ZIO hackathons and making [contributions](https://github.com/zio/zio/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Adkarlinsky+is%3Amerged) to the project.\
Love working on tools that make people's (and especially my) life easier.
