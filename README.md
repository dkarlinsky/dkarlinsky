## About me
A backend Scala developer at Wix.com, working on tooling around our data streaming infrastructure based on Kafka.\
Love FP, recently have been very impressed with [ZIO](https://zio.dev) and its emerging echo-system. Enjoyed attending ZIO hackathons and making contributions to the project.\
Love working on tools that make people's (and especially my) life easier.
